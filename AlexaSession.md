#### Why develop a Skill ?

This is one doubt that we hear around us mostly ;
If you are amongst those STILL thinking why Alexa Skill development should be on your list , 
So here is a reason for you :
  
 *Amazon rewards your effort with their cool "Alexa Shirt"  upon publishing your skill (that too after they certify it)*
 
 *Also , if you are able to get 100 enables , once your skill is live within 30 days , you get an ECHO DOT*

#### What is Amazon Alexa Skill ?

#### The Basic to understand : JSON 

var myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" }; (key,value)
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;


amazon alexa is json enabled device
json->lambda function

get/post reqst-> server -> json response -> parsed
