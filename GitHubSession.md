# GitHub :
##### A Version Control System 

Basic History : 
linus torvalds 

repo- folder much similar to g drive

u can get private  to free -> GitHub student dev pack -> id card -> 2 yr subscription


Working :

local pc ->(commit)-> central version control system ->(push)->GitHub server 
commit -> made a change in local given to vcs
push -> to server 


Two imp /special files :
meant for GitHub repo

readme.md : md :
-> mark down lang
-> gives an info abt your repo
-> an md file is much similar to decorating your file 
good eg : alamofire 
{
markdown cheat sheet
guides.github.com
}

.gitignore :
->when our code is built , eg besides .cpp  no other file should be uploaded
-> some imp files can be saved on local copy but wont be pushed to GitHub
they are “ignored” bu GitHub
