# GitHub 
#### A Version Control System 

----

##### Basic History : 

Linus Torvalds developed the GIT : the HEART of GitHub Website .
While developing the Linux Project , needed a version controller for managing the project well!

##### Why GitHub ?

* distributed version control 
* source code management functionality 
* provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests

-----

#### Some Features :

##### * Repository :
        
        * similar to a folder ; assume it to be just like a drive on your PC.
        * you must always provide description : brief : for your repo
        * Controls possible : public/private (as the name suggest public is visible to all and Private is visible to only us.)
        * Private repos are possible 
          ** after paying
          ** For students: You can have GitHub Student Developer Pack (Use your Id card and the subsrciption last for 2 years. 

Working :

local pc ->(commit)-> central version control system ->(push)->GitHub server 
commit -> made a change in local given to vcs
push -> to server 


Two imp /special files :
meant for GitHub repo

readme.md : md :
-> mark down lang
-> gives an info abt your repo
-> an md file is much similar to decorating your file 
good eg : alamofire 
{
markdown cheat sheet
guides.github.com
}

.gitignore :
->when our code is built , eg besides .cpp  no other file should be uploaded
-> some imp files can be saved on local copy but wont be pushed to GitHub
they are “ignored” bu GitHub
