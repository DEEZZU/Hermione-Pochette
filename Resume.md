## What should your resume contain ??


**3 MAIN THINGS :**

* EDUCATION 
* SITE/PROJECTS
* EXPERIENCE

_Combination of any 2 will work for the resume_

#### Lets talk about the three main points one by one :

1. _**EXPERIENCE :**_

    	DONT mention your position as your experience : like dont ever say i was project assistant or some “blah blah” intern at some firm , RATHER : you should mention in crisp about what you did ?

    	Mention your work on top 

2. _**EDUCATION :**_

    	-> though this is one of the MOST important aspects BUT DONT GET EMOTIONAL IF YOU WERE A BRIGHT STUDENT :: DONT MENTION EDUCATION ON TOP 

    	-> specially in campus placement they are not concerned of what have you studied they obviously already know what you did 

    	-> BUT obviously this is not a field to be left empty , so what goes here ??
    
         If you are a masters person , simply mention Msc/MCA (and your specialisation) and Bsc,
	 
         Dont have to give percentile and schools PLZ 
	 
         If you have scored really well , and got a really good rank , you can may be mention it in achievements or in brackets  

3._**SITE PROJECTS :**_

    	-> mention Tech Projects only 

    	-> here where the ACCURACY RED ZONE starts :
       	 	plz i m reminding you again , mention those projects only which u noe 100% about , or you can fake well 

    	-> Coming to presenting the projects clearly :
        	* Name of the project :
            	one line explaination of what happens in this project 
            	write in pointers 
            	most importantly write what you did ?

### Coming to the other pointers :

_**SKILLS:**_

    	-> dont mention progress and years of your skill 

    	-> avoid using terms like “beginner” and “expert” 

    	-> dont mention simple skills like “MS OFFICE” , I HOPE U REMEMBER THIS IS A TECH RESUME SOOOOO..PLZ SIMPLY DONT

    	-> PLZ DONT mention your hobbies without a significant achievement like national level player , olympiad topper

    	-> Your skill can include either your knowledge or experience

    	-> dont mention more, but precise and the ones you KNOW`

_**ACHIEVEMENTS / COURSES / CERTIFICATION :**_

    	-> MENTION THE SIGNIFICANT ONES FIRST 

    	-> you can include your courses and certification and tech conference participation and event volunteering in this section  

    	-> you can name accordingly

----

### What about personal details ?

    	Your name , phone no and email id are enough 

    	your bio might include links to GitHub/ StackOverflow etc. or Medium Blog/ any blogging site


Phewww…

Hope this helps ! :)
