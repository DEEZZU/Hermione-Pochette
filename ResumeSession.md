#### Coming to the main part :
### Where do we start ??

1. You can have a look on templates provided on Google docs (https://docs.google.com). 
2. You can design a template similar or just use one of them (Microsoft Office / Google Docs).
3. Resume should be short - 1 page is sufficient : Crisp and Clear ,"WRITE LESS THINK MORE"


>##### IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU WRITE IS ACCURATE

### What should your resume contain ??


**3 MAIN THINGS :**

* EDUCATION 
* SITE/PROJECTS
* EXPERIENCE

_Combination of any two will work for the resume_

##### Let's talk about the three main points one by one :

1. _**EXPERIENCE :**_

		DON'T mention your position as your experience : Like don't ever say I was project assistant or some “blah blah” intern 		at some firm , RATHER : you should mention in crisp about what you did ?

    		Mention your work on top. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. _**EDUCATION :**_

    	-> Though this is one of the MOST important aspects BUT DONT GET EMOTIONAL IF YOU WERE A BRIGHT STUDENT :: DONT MENTION EDUCATION ON TOP 

    	-> Specially in campus placement, they are not concerned of what have you studied they obviously already know what you did. 

    	-> BUT obviously, this is not a field to be left empty , so what goes here ??
    
         If you are a masters person , simply mention M.Sc./MCA (and your specialisation) and B.Sc.,
	 
         Dont have to give percentile and schools PLZ 
	 
         If you have scored really well , and got a really good rank , you can may be mention it in achievements or in brackets.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. _**SITE PROJECTS :**_

    	-> Mention Tech Projects only. 

    	-> Here where the ACCURACY RED ZONE starts :
       	 	Please! I am reminding you again, mention those projects only which you noe 100% about , or you can fake well. 

    	-> Coming to presenting the projects clearly :
        	* Name of the project :
            	  One line explaination of what happens in this project 
            	  Write in pointers 
            	  Most importantly write what you did ?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Coming to the other pointers :

4. _**SKILLS:**_

    	-> Don't mention progress and years of your skill. 

    	-> Avoid using terms like “beginner” and “expert”. 

    	-> Don't mention simple skills like “MS OFFICE” , I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS IS A TECH RESUME SOOOOO..PLEASE SIMPLY DON'T.

    	-> PLEASE DON'T mention your hobbies without a significant achievement like National Level Player , Olympiad Topper.

    	-> Your skill can include either your knowledge or experience.

    	-> Don't mention more, but precise and the ones you KNOW.
------------------------------------------------------------------

5. _**ACHIEVEMENTS / COURSES / CERTIFICATION :**_

    	-> MENTION THE SIGNIFICANT ONES FIRST. 

    	-> You can include your courses and certification and tech conference participation and event volunteering in this section.  

    	-> You can name accordingly

---------------------------------------------------

#### What about personal details ?

	Your name , Phone Number and Email Id are enough.
	Note (On Email ID): Avoid stupid looking emails like smarthacker@gamil.com or like that. 
			    Maintain a professional looking Email ID for professional purposes.
	Your bio might include links to GitHub/ StackOverflow etc. or Medium Blog/ any blogging site.
